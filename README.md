### How It Works 

* Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. 
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page; waiting to be consumed. 
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a button to eat it. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 
* Burgers on the right side of the page have a delete button to remove it from view. 
* The app stores every burger in a database whether eaten or not. 

### Technologies Used
**HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, **MySQL**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **Handlebars**,  **MVC**, and **ORM**.
